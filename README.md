# 🌿 Eco-Friendly Purification System

An intelligent, sustainable air quality monitoring and purification system designed for homes, greenhouses, and smart agriculture environments. This project detects harmful air pollutants and activates eco-friendly purification methods, promoting clean air using natural, low-energy solutions.

---

## 🔍 Description

The **Eco-Friendly Purification System** monitors key environmental parameters such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature (°C)
- 💧 Humidity (%)
- 🫁 CO₂ concentration (ppm)
- 🌫️ PM2.5 particulate levels (µg/m³)

When any of these values exceed safe thresholds, the system automatically initiates purification actions such as natural filtration, ventilation, or air-purifying plant activation. The system supports real-time sensor readings, threshold-based control, and optional solar power integration.

## 🌱 Key Features

- Real-time air quality monitoring
- Automated alert and response system
- Low-power and eco-friendly operation
- Sensor-driven control (e.g., fans, filters, vents)
- Modular and hardware-agnostic (can work with Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
- Optional solar energy support
- Data logging and visualization (via Python + matplotlib)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Sensors: MQ135/MH-Z19 (CO₂), SDS011 (PM2.5), DHT22 (Temp/Humidity)
- Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi / Arduino (optional)
- `matplotlib` (optional) for plotting
- `logging` for system feedback and debugging
